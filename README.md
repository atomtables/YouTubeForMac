# YouTubeForMac

YouTubeForMac was a fun learning adventure where I created a custom native client for watching YouTube videos. However, due to the length of time it has been since last touching it, the relative instability with the Invidious API, and for personal reasons, I have closed it, seeing as there are much better clients out there anyway.
